For example, let's have an entry for `glossary`.[^glossary] And what about
ampersands?[^amp]

Since we want the ampersand entry to be sorted with the a's, and not with
symbols, we put in the optional sort key `ampersand` to control sorting.

[^glossary]: glossary: Glossary 
	A section at the end ...

[^amp]: glossary: & (ampersand)
	A punctuation mark ...
